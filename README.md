# MNIST
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
In this project, we have a diffrents neural networks on MNIST dataset - convolution(add layers, with Droupt...) and regression logistic.
Every model load and print success factors ( Recall, Precision, score F1, Accuracy) on the test and trian set.
All the models use Adam optimization algorithm('model.compile(optimizer='adam')) and output layer softmax.
I'm use tensorflow-  source platform for machine learning in python.

Thanks!
